Key Metrics to Monitor:
Accuracy: Measures how often the model correctly identifies fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.
Precision: The percentage of fraud alerts that are true positives (i.e., how many of the flagged transactions are genuinely fraudulent).
Recall: The percentage of actual fraudulent transactions that are correctly identified by the model.
F1 Score: The balance between precision and recall.
Area Under the Curve (AUC): Performance metric for binary classification models, evaluating the trade-off between true positives and false positives.
False Positive Rate (FPR): The rate at which legitimate transactions are incorrectly flagged as fraudulent.
False Negative Rate (FNR): The rate at which fraudulent transactions are missed by the model.
Monitoring Frequency: Banks should monitor these metrics in near real-time (daily/weekly) to ensure the model performs as expected.


If the false positive rate exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 5% or 10%), it could trigger an alert for investigation.
If the fraud detection rate drops below a set threshold (e.g., 80%), it can trigger an investigation.
