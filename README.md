| **RAG Status** | **FAR Threshold** | **FRR Threshold** | **Action Plan & Frequency** | **Escalation Level & Timeline** |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ **Green**   | **‚â§ 10%**          | **‚â§ 7%**          | - Maintain fraud detection settings. <br> - **Review quarterly** | **Escalation Level**: No escalation required. <br> **Timeline**: **Ongoing monitoring**. No immediate action needed unless performance deviates. |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Amber**  | **10% - 15%**      | **7% - 12%**      | - Notify fraud team for analysis. <br> - Fine-tune detection thresholds and review fraud-loss vs. user friction. <br> - **Review monthly** | **Escalation Level**: **Fraud Detection Team**. <br> **Timeline**: Analyze within **2 weeks**, apply adjustments, and resolve within **1 month**.

### **Escalation Plan Details:**

- **Green Zone (No Escalation)**:
   - **Escalation Level**: No escalation required, as the model performance is within acceptable limits.
   - **Timeline**: Continuous monitoring with **quarterly review**. Action is only triggered if performance deviates significantly.

- **Amber Zone (Fraud Detection Team)**:
   - **Escalation Level**: The **Fraud Detection Team** is alerted for deeper investigation. The team reviews model thresholds, assesses fraud loss, and user impact, and fine-tunes parameters.
   - **Timeline**: **2-week investigation** followed by adjustments. If the issue persists beyond **1 month**, escalate to **senior management** for deeper review and decision-making.

- **Red Zone (Senior Management & Compliance Team)**:
   - **Escalation Level**: Immediate investigation by **Senior Management** and the **Compliance Team** to address high fraud risk or high false rejections. Root cause analysis is performed along with model retraining and additional safeguards (e.g., manual review processes).
   - **Timeline**: **Immediate action** is required. A preliminary review must be conducted within **3 days**. Corrective actions should be implemented and completed within **2 weeks**. If the problem remains unresolved, escalate to **executive leadership** for additional resources and a strategic action plan within **3 weeks**.

### **Summary of Escalation Timelines:**
- **Green**: No escalation needed, regular **quarterly reviews**.
- **Amber**: **Review within 2 weeks**, corrective actions within **1 month**, escalate to **senior management** if unresolved.
- **Red**: **Immediate action** within **3 days**, corrective actions within **2 weeks**, escalate to **executive leadership** if unresolved in **3 weeks**.
