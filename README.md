Acuant plays a critical role in ensuring the security and legitimacy of the Digital Banking new account onboarding process. When applicants apply for a new account through the Digital Banking platform, they are required to submit an image of their ID. Acuant is used to scan and analyze these ID images to validate their authenticity and ensure they have not been tampered with.

Acuant uses two key validation scores to perform this analysis:

Authentication Result: This score evaluates whether the ID appears to be genuine. It checks for various security features typically found in legitimate identification documents, such as watermarks, holograms, and other indicators of authenticity. If the ID matches these expected characteristics, the Authentication Result will indicate that the ID is likely valid.

Tampering Result: This score detects any alterations made to the ID image. Acuant looks for signs of image manipulation, such as changes to text, photo alterations, or cropping, all of which may indicate the ID has been falsified. If tampering is suspected, the Tampering Result will flag the ID for further review.

Acuant operates in a cloud-based environment, meaning that it is hosted remotely rather than on the premises of the financial institution. This cloud infrastructure ensures that the ID scanning process is scalable, secure, and efficient, with all data being processed in real-time through the cloud.

The production environment refers to the actual live environment where Acuant is integrated within the Digital Banking onboarding flow. When applicants submit their ID images as part of applying for a new account, Acuant performs its scanning and validation tasks to ensure the submitted IDs are both authentic and untampered with.

By leveraging Acuant in this automated process, Digital Banking can quickly and accurately detect potential fraud, improving security during the account creation process while providing a smooth and seamless experience for legitimate applicants.
