Monitoring Plan for Acuant Fraud Detection System 

Shape 

1. What is Acuant? 

Acuant is a third-party, cloud-based, black-box solution integrated within the bankâ€™s digital onboarding platform, specifically for deposit product applicants. 
It performs real-time document verification and tampering detection: 

Document Authentication: 
Validates official documents (Driverâ€™s License, Passport, Birth Certificate, Digital Identity Token) uploaded by applicants. 

Tampering Detection: 

Photo Tampering Detection: Checks if the photo section of a document has been fraudulently substituted (e.g., cut-paste manipulation). 

Physical Document Presence Detection: Ensures the ID shown is a real, physically-present document â€” not a screen capture or replayed video. 

Text Tampering Detection: Detects whether textual fields like Name or Date of Birth have been altered on the document. 

âœ… The Acuant service is embedded into the digital onboarding flow. 
âœ… It is triggered automatically â€” the system sends applicant data to Acuant, and Acuant returns an instant decision (Accept / Reject) along with tampering flags. 

âœ… Important: 
We do not have access to Acuantâ€™s internal model (proprietary logic). Monitoring must rely purely on input-output observations.

ðŸ”¹ 2. What We Intend to Do (Our Monitoring Strategy) 

Since we cannot validate the model internally, the monitoring plan will focus on: 

a) Operational Monitoring 

Was Acuant triggered for every applicant as expected? 

Was the Acuant API response successful (no technical failure)? 

Was the response time acceptable? 

b) Output Monitoring 

What % of applicants are flagged for tampering (Photo, Text, Physical Presence)? 

Are there sudden spikes or drops in tampering rates (model drift or technical issue)? 

c) Proxy Performance Monitoring 

How many applicants cleared by Acuant later turn out to be fraud? 

Are false negatives increasing? 

d) Input Data Quality Monitoring 

Are the documents uploaded by applicants in good quality (clear, not blurred)? 

Are there failures during document upload? 

e) Thresholds and Alerts 

Set normal baseline ranges for each metric. 

Trigger Amber/Red alerts when thresholds are breached.

Column Name 

Purpose 

application_id 

Unique ID for each applicant 

application_date 

For daily/weekly volume tracking 

product_type 

Helps to segment monitoring if needed 

acuant_api_triggered_flag 

1 if Acuant was triggered for applicant 

acuant_response_status 

Success or Failure of Acuant response 

acuant_response_time_sec 

Time from request to response in seconds 

acuant_final_decision 

Accept / Reject decision by Acuant 

photo_tampering_flag 

1 if photo tampering detected 

text_tampering_flag 

1 if text tampering detected 

physical_presence_flag 

1 if physical document spoof detected 

manual_review_required_flag 

1 if applicant was manually reviewed post-Acuant 

final_kyc_decision 

Approved / Rejected by the bank (final onboarding decision) 

document_upload_quality_flag 

1 if document upload was blurry or unreadable 

fraud_case_reported_flag 

1 if applicant later found to be fraud

Metric 

Calculation 

Industry Benchmark Example 

Acuant Utilization Rate 

Successful Acuant Responses / Applicants 

> 98% 

Average Response Time 

Avg(acuant_response_time_sec) 

< 2 seconds 

Photo Tampering Rate 

Sum(photo_tampering_flag) / Successful Applicants 

~1% typical 

Text Tampering Rate 

Sum(text_tampering_flag) / Successful Applicants 

~0.5% typical 

Physical Presence Issue Rate 

Sum(physical_presence_flag) / Successful Applicants 

~0.2%â€“0.5% 

Manual Review Escalation Rate 

Sum(manual_review_required_flag) / Total Applicants 

<2% 

False Negative Proxy Rate 

Fraud Cases Missed / Applicants Cleared by Acuant 

<0.1% 

Poor Document Upload Rate 

Poor Uploads / Total Applicants 

<1.5%

ðŸ”¹ 5. Example with Hypothetical Numbers 

Suppose in 1 day: 

10,000 applicants 

9,950 successfully processed by Acuant 

100 flagged for photo tampering 

50 flagged for text tampering 

25 flagged for physical presence issues 

5 fraud cases later reported from applicants Acuant accepted 

Metrics would be: 

Acuant Utilization Rate = 9,950/10,000 = 99.5% âœ… 

Photo Tampering Rate = 100/9,950 â‰ˆ 1% âœ… 

Text Tampering Rate = 50/9,950 â‰ˆ 0.5% âœ… 

Physical Presence Issue Rate = 25/9,950 â‰ˆ 0.25% âœ… 

False Negative Proxy Rate = 5/9,950 â‰ˆ 0.05% âœ… 

All numbers within healthy, expected bands.
