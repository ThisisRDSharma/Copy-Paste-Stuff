� RAG Status Framework for AFPR Monitoring**  

This framework defines the **Account False Positive Ratio (AFPR) thresholds**, the associated **monitoring actions**, and a **multi-level escalation process** to ensure timely intervention and mitigation of risks in credit and debit card fraud detection models.  

---

## **1️⃣ AFPR Thresholds & Interpretation**  

| **Status**  | **AFPR Range** (False Positives per True Positive) | **Interpretation & Business Impact** |
|------------|---------------------------------|----------------|
| =�â� **Green**  | **AFPR ≤ 8**  | The model is effectively distinguishing between fraudulent and genuine accounts. False positive rates are within an acceptable range, ensuring minimal customer impact and strong fraud detection performance. |
| =�à� **Amber**  | **8 < AFPR ≤ 15** | The model is flagging more false positives than ideal, leading to increased customer complaints, operational workload, and potential revenue loss due to customer attrition. Needs closer monitoring and assessment. |
| =�4� **Red**  | **AFPR > 15**  | The false positive rate is excessively high, significantly impacting customer experience and operational efficiency. This could indicate model drift, ineffective fraud rules, or threshold misalignment. Immediate action is required. |

## **2️⃣ Action Plan & Multi-Level Escalation Process**  

This section outlines the **required response** for each AFPR status, with a structured **three-level escalation plan** to ensure accountability and timely resolution.  

### **=�â� Green Status (AFPR ≤ 8) – Low Risk**  
✅ **Action Plan:**  
- Maintain standard fraud monitoring procedures.  
- Conduct a **quarterly** review of AFPR trends.  
- Ensure fraud detection performance aligns with business goals.  

=�«� **Escalation:**  
- No immediate escalation required.  
- Regular reporting to fraud operations and risk management teams.  

---

### **=�à� Amber Status (8 < AFPR ≤ 15) – Moderate Risk**  
⚠️ **Action Plan:**  
- Investigate the causes of increased false positives (e.g., rule-based thresholds, model drift, emerging fraud trends).  
- Assess **customer complaints, operational impact, and chargeback trends**.  
- Increase AFPR monitoring to **monthly** frequency.  
- Fine-tune model parameters or fraud rules if needed.  

=�Ì� **Escalation Plan (Level 1 & 2):**  
- **Level 1:** Escalate to the **Fraud Strategy Team** for a detailed review and corrective action plan.  
- **Level 2:** If AFPR remains **Amber for two consecutive months**, escalate to the **Fraud Risk Governance Committee** for intervention and additional risk assessment.  

---

### **=�4� Red Status (AFPR > 15) – High Risk**  
=�¨� **Action Plan:**  
- **Immediate** investigation by fraud analytics and model governance teams.  
- Conduct a **root cause analysis** to identify:  
  - Model degradation or misclassification issues.  
  - Overly aggressive fraud rule settings.  
  - Emerging fraud patterns requiring new detection strategies.  
- Implement urgent mitigations (e.g., manual review overrides, temporary rule adjustments).  
- Increase monitoring frequency to **bi-weekly** until improvement is observed.  

=�Ì� **Escalation Plan (Level 3 & 4):**  
- **Level 3:** Immediate escalation to **Senior Risk Leadership & Fraud Operations Management** for strategic intervention.  
- **Level 4:** If AFPR remains **Red for two consecutive review cycles**, escalate to the **Executive Risk Committee (ERC)** for executive-level oversight and potential model retraining or regulatory compliance review.

## **3️⃣ Summary of Escalation Levels**  

| **Escalation Level** | **Triggered When** | **Responsible Team** | **Actions** |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Level 1** | AFPR enters Amber status | Fraud Strategy Team | Conduct analysis, suggest corrective actions |
| **Level 2** | AFPR remains Amber for 2 months | Fraud Risk Governance Committee | Review model effectiveness, implement refinements |
| **Level 3** | AFPR enters Red status | Senior Risk Leadership & Fraud Operations | Immediate corrective measures, manual interventions |
| **Level 4** | AFPR remains Red for 2 cycles | Executive Risk Committee (ERC) | High-level strategic intervention, potential model retraining |

---

### **Final Notes:**  
- **Monitoring Frequency:**  
  - **Green:** **Quarterly**  
  - **Amber:** **Monthly**  
  - **Red:** **Bi-weekly**  
- **Multi-level Escalation ensures:**  
  - **Proactive issue resolution** before AFPR becomes a business risk.  
  - **Accountability at every level**, from operational teams to executive leadership.  
  - **Alignment with regulatory and business requirements** for fraud detection performance.
