For fraud models, setting an appropriate ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) threshold is crucial to balance false positives and false negatives. The threshold determines whether a transaction is classified as fraudulent or not. Based on this threshold, we can define **Red, Amber, and Green (RAG) status** for fraud models and outline the **escalation plan** accordingly.

### **ROC Threshold & RAG Status Classification**
| **RAG Status** | **ROC Threshold (AUC Score %)** | **Implication** |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Green**   | **> 85%**  | Model is performing well, minimal intervention needed |
| **Amber**   | **70% - 85%**  | Model performance is moderate; monitoring and fine-tuning required |
| **Red**     | **< 70%**  | Model performance is poor; urgent intervention required |

### **Escalation Plan Based on RAG Status**

#### ‚úÖ **Green Zone (>85%)**
- No immediate action is required.
- Regular model performance monitoring (e.g., monthly or quarterly checks).
- Continue tracking key performance indicators (KPIs).

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Amber Zone (70%-85%)**
- Alert the **modelling team** and **fraud risk analysts**.
- Conduct feature recalibration (e.g., retrain model with fresh data).
- Monitor false positive/negative rates.
- Re-evaluate the fraud detection threshold settings.
- Escalate to **Fraud Risk Manager** if performance continues to decline for two consecutive cycles.

#### üî¥ **Red Zone (<70%)**
- Immediate alert to **Modelling Team, Fraud Risk Manager, and Compliance Team**.
- Root cause analysis: Identify drift in data, label quality, or feature degradation.
- Deploy backup fraud detection measures (rule-based alerts, manual reviews).
- Retrain the model with new data.
- Escalate to **Senior Management & Compliance** if performance does not improve within one month.

Would you like me to refine this further based on specific fraud detection models (e.g., ML, rule-based, hybrid)?
