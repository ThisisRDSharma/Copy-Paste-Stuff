## its model output, need a bit descriptive !!

The key output is the response that Acuant returns for both authentication and tampering detection scores/recommendations. Acuant returns authentication & tampering indicators/recommendations that can be used by the BSA team when reviewing an application. The results from the Acuant check are added to the Salesforce application case which is used by BSA to review and ultimately approve or reject applications based on their review. Acuant is also used in combination with iProov to compare the image of the selfie to the image on the ID.

### Elaborated verison of above:

Here’s a more elaborative version of your paragraph:

---

The primary output generated by Acuant consists of the authentication and tampering detection scores, along with corresponding recommendations. These outputs serve as critical indicators for assessing the authenticity and integrity of identity documents. Acuant's response includes detailed insights and recommendations that aid the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) team in their application review process. Specifically, the authentication and tampering indicators help the team determine whether an identity document is genuine or has been altered in any way.

The results from the Acuant evaluation are seamlessly integrated into the relevant Salesforce application case, ensuring that all necessary information is readily available to the BSA team. This consolidated view in Salesforce allows the team to thoroughly review the application and make informed decisions on whether to approve or reject it based on the provided data and their overall assessment.

Additionally, Acuant is employed in tandem with iProov technology to enhance identity verification. iProov facilitates biometric comparisons by analyzing the selfie image provided by the applicant and matching it against the photograph on their submitted identification document. This combined approach ensures a robust and comprehensive verification process, contributing to enhanced security and fraud prevention.

## for overview, frame this information in a more presentable paragraph.

Portfolios, Products, and/or Banking Transaction Channels the Quantitative Process Applies to: Instruction: Please list the portfolio names and dollar amount (e.g., total commitment amount, total balance amount, etc.) this quantitative process is applied to.

Acuant applies to customers who onboarded via the Digital Bank. As of 12/22/23 there were 49,565 customers with active accounts that were digitally onboarded, aggregate portfolio balance (deposit account) of $1,056,728,608.05.

The dataset is currently comprised of over 53,000 Live, 63,000 Print, and 42,000 Screen images that include various image resolutions, capture techniques, visual pattern controls, cropping controls, and capture device-specific controls.

**Portfolios, Products, and/or Banking Transaction Channels the Quantitative Process Applies To**  

**Instruction:** Please list the portfolio names and dollar amounts (e.g., total commitment amount, total balance amount, etc.) this quantitative process is applied to.  

The Acuant quantitative process is designed to support identity verification and fraud prevention for customers who onboard through the **Digital Bank platform**. This process plays a critical role in ensuring that the onboarding experience is secure, efficient, and compliant with regulatory standards.  

As of **December 22, 2023**, the following metrics reflect the scope of this process within the Digital Bank portfolio:  
- **Active Customers:** 49,565 individuals who completed the digital onboarding process and hold active accounts.  
- **Aggregate Portfolio Balance:** $1,056,728,608.05, representing the total balance across deposit accounts held by digitally onboarded customers.  

To achieve reliable and accurate identity verification, Acuant leverages a comprehensive and diverse dataset consisting of more than **158,000 images**, categorized as follows:  
1. **Live Images (53,000):** Captured in real-time during customer interactions to ensure authenticity and minimize the risk of document tampering or misuse.  
2. **Print Images (63,000):** Digitized representations of physical identity documents, including scans or high-quality photographs.  
3. **Screen Images (42,000):** Digital captures of documents displayed on electronic screens, such as smartphones, tablets, or computer monitors.  

The dataset is meticulously curated to account for a wide range of real-world variables, ensuring the robustness of the quantitative process. Key attributes of the dataset include:  
- **Image Resolutions:** Encompassing various quality levels to simulate diverse capture conditions and device capabilities.  
- **Capture Techniques:** Incorporating both automated and manual methods to reflect the variability in how documents are processed.  
- **Visual Pattern Controls:** Addressing differences in lighting, texture, and background patterns to enhance image analysis accuracy.  
- **Cropping Controls:** Standardizing image framing and alignment to ensure critical document features are consistently visible.  
- **Device-Specific Parameters:** Accounting for the unique characteristics of capture devices, such as cameras on smartphones or dedicated scanners.  

This combination of advanced technology and a meticulously prepared dataset enables Acuant to provide accurate, secure, and scalable identity verification, supporting the integrity of the Digital Bank's onboarding and account management processes.

## frame it as DATA SOURCES AND Discuss the relevance of the development data to the modeling objective.

Newer Machine Learning security tests require large amounts of image data, and it takes significantly longer to tune these tests to be highly accurate in detection while keeping a low false-positive rate.

###

**DATA SOURCES AND RELEVANCE TO THE MODELING OBJECTIVE**  

The development of newer machine learning-based security tests necessitates access to extensive image datasets. These datasets are crucial for training and fine-tuning models to achieve high accuracy in detecting fraudulent or tampered images while minimizing the rate of false positives. The relevance of this development data lies in its ability to support the modeling objective: creating robust, reliable, and efficient detection mechanisms. 

Large volumes of image data enable the models to learn and generalize from a wide variety of patterns, scenarios, and anomalies. This diversity ensures the system can handle real-world complexities, such as varying image quality, lighting conditions, and capture techniques. Moreover, the iterative process of tuning the models with such comprehensive datasets is critical to balancing detection sensitivity with operational efficiency, ensuring security tests remain both accurate and practical for deployment.
## Judgemental Adjustments

Describe and justify any judgmental overlays/overrides of statistically estimated input parameters. If any such adjustments are intended to be conservative, explain in what way they are conservative. Note: this section should not be used to detail any overlays/overrides to the model outputs (described in Section 3.3.11. Need for Model Overlays).

## 3.3.2.1	In-sample Performance/Fit

Note: 

Provide testing of model performance / fit on the estimation and hold-out samples, including calculations of relative and absolute model errors for different population/product/portfolio risk segments and time periods. For some models, their fit can be evaluated using various additional statistical metrics and analytical techniques. This includes, for example: the K-S test, ROC curves (and AUC/Gini coefficient and similar measures of discriminatory power), lift charts, Precision/Recall, F1 score, risk profiling, etc.

For vendor models, include the model owner’s assessment of the model performance/fit testing results provided by vendor (based on vendor’s data) and any associated risks. In addition, include testing results on the Company’s internal data (or explain why it is not feasible). 


Use this section for the testing of model performance/fit on the data on which the model was estimated/trained.
