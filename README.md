For fraud models, setting an appropriate ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) threshold is crucial to balance false positives and false negatives. The threshold determines whether a transaction is classified as fraudulent or not. Based on this threshold, we can define **Red, Amber, and Green (RAG) status** for fraud models and outline the **escalation plan** accordingly.

---

### **ROC Threshold & RAG Status Classification**
| **RAG Status** | **ROC Threshold (AUC Score %)** | **Implication** |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Green**   | **> 85%**  | Model is performing well, minimal intervention needed |
| **Amber**   | **70% - 85%**  | Model performance is moderate; monitoring and fine-tuning required |
| **Red**     | **< 70%**  | Model performance is poor; urgent intervention required |

---

### **Escalation Plan Based on RAG Status**

#### ‚úÖ **Green Zone (>85%)**
- No immediate action is required.
- Regular model performance monitoring (e.g., monthly or quarterly checks).
- Continue tracking key performance indicators (KPIs).

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Amber Zone (70%-85%)**
- Alert the **modelling team** and **fraud risk analysts**.
- Conduct feature recalibration (e.g., retrain model with fresh data).
- Monitor false positive/negative rates.
- Re-evaluate the fraud detection threshold settings.
- Escalate to **Fraud Risk Manager** if performance continues to decline for two consecutive cycles.

#### üî¥ **Red Zone (<70%)**
- Immediate alert to **Modelling Team, Fraud Risk Manager, and Compliance Team**.
- Root cause analysis: Identify drift in data, label quality, or feature degradation.
- Deploy backup fraud detection measures (rule-based alerts, manual reviews).
- Retrain the model with new data.
- Escalate to **Senior Management & Compliance** if performance does not improve within one month.

### **ROC Threshold & Escalation Frequency Plan for Fraud Models**  

We define the frequency of **monitoring, escalation, and intervention** based on the **RAG status (Red, Amber, Green)** of the fraud model's performance.

---

### **Monitoring & Escalation Frequency Based on RAG Status**  

| **RAG Status** | **ROC Threshold (AUC Score %)** | **Review Frequency** | **Escalation Plan** |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| ‚úÖ **Green**   | **> 85%**  | **Quarterly (Every 3 Months)** | No immediate action, standard monitoring & periodic reporting. |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Amber**   | **70% - 85%**  | **Monthly Review** | Flag to **modelling team & fraud analysts**, fine-tune features, adjust thresholds. Escalate if performance declines for **2 consecutive months**. |
| üî¥ **Red**     | **< 70%**  | **Weekly Review** | **Immediate intervention** required. Alert Modelling Team, Fraud Risk Manager, and Compliance. If not resolved within **1 month**, escalate to **Senior Management & Compliance**. |

---

### **Escalation Path & Responsibilities**
| **Stage** | **Trigger Condition** | **Action Plan** | **Escalation To** | **Resolution Timeframe** |
|------------|--------------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Stage 1: Monitoring** | Normal AUC (>85%) | Continue regular tracking, periodic review. | Modelling Team | Ongoing |
| **Stage 2: Performance Decline (Amber)** | AUC drops to **70-85%** for **2 consecutive months** | Adjust model features, retrain if needed, monitor false positives/negatives. | Fraud Analysts & Modelling Team | **Within 1 month** |
| **Stage 3: Critical Drop (Red)** | AUC **<70%** | Immediate alert, root cause analysis, deploy alternative fraud detection measures. | Fraud Risk Manager, Compliance | **Within 2 weeks** |
| **Stage 4: Senior Escalation** | AUC **remains <70%** for **1 month** | Urgent model retraining, external review, business impact analysis. | Senior Management, Compliance Head | **Within 1 month** |

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Green Zone** ‚Üí Review **quarterly**, no action needed.  
- **Amber Zone** ‚Üí Review **monthly**, escalate if deteriorating for **2 months**.  
- **Red Zone** ‚Üí Review **weekly**, **immediate intervention** required.  
- If a model remains in **Red for over 1 month**, escalate to **Senior Management & Compliance**.  

Would you like to add any specific governance or audit checkpoints to this plan?

Would you like me to refine this further based on specific fraud detection models (e.g., ML, rule-based, hybrid)?
