### **Fraud Model ROC Threshold, Frequency, and Escalation Plan**  

| **RAG Status** | **ROC Threshold (AUC %)** | **Monitoring Frequency** | **Action Plan** | **Escalation Plan** |  
|--------------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|  
| ‚úÖ **Green**   | **> 85%**  | **Quarterly** | - Continue monitoring model performance.  <br>- Track key fraud KPIs.  <br>- No intervention required unless declining trend observed. | - No escalation required. <br>- Regular model review by **Modelling Team** & **Fraud Risk Analysts**. |  
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Amber**   | **70% - 85%**  | **Monthly** | - Investigate feature drift and performance degradation. <br>- Conduct model recalibration with new data. <br>- Adjust fraud detection thresholds if necessary. <br>- Increase monitoring of false positives/negatives. | - **Level 1:** Notify **Modelling Team** and **Fraud Risk Manager**. <br>- **Level 2:** If performance remains in Amber for 2 consecutive months, escalate to **Head of Risk & Fraud Team**. <br>- **Level 3:** If performance drops toward 70% threshold, initiate **model retraining or replacement assessment**. |  
| üî¥ **Red**   | **< 70%**  | **Bi-Weekly** | - Conduct immediate root cause analysis. <br>- Identify data drift, feature quality issues, or model deterioration. <br>- Implement emergency fraud detection measures (rule-based alerts, manual reviews). <br>- Start model retraining with latest data. | - **Level 1:** Immediate alert to **Modelling Team, Fraud Risk Manager & Compliance Team**. <br>- **Level 2:** If ROC remains <70% for **4 weeks**, escalate to **Head of Fraud & Senior Management**. <br>- **Level 3:** If no improvement in 8 weeks, **escalate to Regulatory & Compliance Authorities** (if required). <br>- **Final Step:** Deploy backup fraud models while retraining or replacing the underperforming model. |

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Green Models** are reviewed quarterly with no escalation unless a negative trend is detected.  
- **Amber Models** require **monthly** review, and if underperformance persists, escalation moves to **senior risk leaders**.  
- **Red Models** are checked **bi-weekly**, with a rapid escalation plan involving senior management, compliance, and potential regulatory action.

Here‚Äôs a more descriptive escalation plan with a detailed course of action for the **Modelling Department**:

### **Descriptive Escalation Plan for Modeling Department**

| **Risk Level** | **Threshold for FAR** | **Threshold for FRR** | **Course of Action** | **Escalation Process** |
|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Green** (Low Risk) | FAR ‚â§ 10% | FRR ‚â§ 5% | 1. **Review the Model's Performance**: Regular validation and review of model accuracy. <br> 2. **Periodic Data Analysis**: Ensure the model is adjusting to the latest data trends. <br> 3. **Fine-Tuning**: Minor improvements, such as adjusting decision boundaries, if needed. | No immediate escalation needed. **Continuous monitoring** through regular checks by the modelling team. |
| **Amber** (Moderate Risk) | 10% < FAR ‚â§ 15% | 5% < FRR ‚â§ 8% | 1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Detailed investigation of why FAR/FRR exceeded thresholds. <br> 2. **Model Recalibration**: Update model parameters or retrain the model using more recent or diverse datasets. <br> 3. **Threshold Adjustment**: Consider adjusting the thresholds for FAR/FRR based on ongoing trends. | **Escalate to Fraud Risk & Modelling Team**: Share findings and consider joint review meetings for model refinements. |
| **Red** (High Risk) | FAR > 15% | FRR > 8% | 1. **Immediate Model Audit**: Conduct an urgent audit of the model to identify issues such as overfitting, underfitting, or drift. <br> 2. **Alternative Fraud Detection Measures**: Implement manual reviews, stricter rules, or supplementary checks (e.g., multi-factor authentication). <br> 3. **Model Re-Training**: Initiate retraining with new data, adjusting model architecture, or applying advanced algorithms. <br> 4. **Impact Assessment**: Review customer experience and fraud impact to determine how the breach may have affected operational efficiency. | **Escalate to Senior Management & Executive Team**: Report immediately for decision-making on escalated risk management protocols. Consider a full investigation across all affected systems. |

This plan gives clarity on the actions needed and the escalation levels within the Modelling Department for each risk level, ensuring that any breach is addressed swiftly and effectively. Let me know if you'd like to make further adjustments!
