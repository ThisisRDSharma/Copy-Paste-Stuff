Output and Usage:

The key output from Acuant consists of authentication and tampering detection scores or recommendations. These scores provide an assessment of the applicant’s ID, indicating whether it appears authentic or has been altered. The authentication score helps verify if the ID matches expected patterns for legitimate documents, while the tampering score checks if any alterations or modifications have been made to the ID.

These results are used by the BSA (Bank Secrecy Act) team when reviewing a new account application. The authentication and tampering scores are integrated into the Salesforce application case. This allows the BSA team to track and assess each application, using the scores to make an informed decision on whether to approve or reject the application. 

In addition to Acuant’s checks, the system also works in combination with iProov, a biometric verification tool, which compares the applicant's selfie with the photo on the ID to ensure that the person applying matches the ID. This multi-step verification process ensures greater accuracy in confirming the applicant’s identity.

Output Impact:

If Acuant detects any failures or issues with the authentication or tampering scores, the system immediately alerts the BSA team. This alert prompts the team to perform a manual review of the application to further investigate and confirm whether the application should be accepted or rejected.
