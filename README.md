## its model output, need a bit descriptive !!

The key output is the response that Acuant returns for both authentication and tampering detection scores/recommendations. Acuant returns authentication & tampering indicators/recommendations that can be used by the BSA team when reviewing an application. The results from the Acuant check are added to the Salesforce application case which is used by BSA to review and ultimately approve or reject applications based on their review. Acuant is also used in combination with iProov to compare the image of the selfie to the image on the ID.



## for overview, frame this information in a more presentable paragraph.

Portfolios, Products, and/or Banking Transaction Channels the Quantitative Process Applies to: Instruction: Please list the portfolio names and dollar amount (e.g., total commitment amount, total balance amount, etc.) this quantitative process is applied to.

Acuant applies to customers who onboarded via the Digital Bank. As of 12/22/23 there were 49,565 customers with active accounts that were digitally onboarded, aggregate portfolio balance (deposit account) of $1,056,728,608.05.

The dataset is currently comprised of over 53,000 Live, 63,000 Print, and 42,000 Screen images that include various image resolutions, capture techniques, visual pattern controls, cropping controls, and capture device-specific controls.


## frame it as DATA SOURCES AND Discuss the relevance of the development data to the modeling objective.

Newer Machine Learning security tests require large amounts of image data, and it takes significantly longer to tune these tests to be highly accurate in detection while keeping a low false-positive rate.

## Judgemental Adjustments

Describe and justify any judgmental overlays/overrides of statistically estimated input parameters. If any such adjustments are intended to be conservative, explain in what way they are conservative. Note: this section should not be used to detail any overlays/overrides to the model outputs (described in Section 3.3.11. Need for Model Overlays).

## 3.3.2.1	In-sample Performance/Fit

Note: 

Provide testing of model performance / fit on the estimation and hold-out samples, including calculations of relative and absolute model errors for different population/product/portfolio risk segments and time periods. For some models, their fit can be evaluated using various additional statistical metrics and analytical techniques. This includes, for example: the K-S test, ROC curves (and AUC/Gini coefficient and similar measures of discriminatory power), lift charts, Precision/Recall, F1 score, risk profiling, etc.

For vendor models, include the model owner’s assessment of the model performance/fit testing results provided by vendor (based on vendor’s data) and any associated risks. In addition, include testing results on the Company’s internal data (or explain why it is not feasible). 


Use this section for the testing of model performance/fit on the data on which the model was estimated/trained.
