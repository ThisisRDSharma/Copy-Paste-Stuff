The key input data for the Acuant system is the ID that needs to be scanned and verified during the digital onboarding process. To facilitate this, Acuant leverages the mobile phone's camera to capture a high-quality image of the applicant's ID.

Acuant is designed to integrate directly with the mobile device’s camera software, allowing it to automatically detect and capture the ID without requiring any additional specialized equipment or setup. 

This method ensures that the ID scan is captured with precision, making it easier for the applicant to complete the verification process without needing to visit a physical location or use a dedicated scanning device. The use of the mobile camera also enables a smooth, self-service experience, where the applicant controls the process and can instantly upload their ID for further validation. 

In summary, Acuant’s integration with the applicant's mobile phone camera makes it highly convenient and efficient for users to securely scan and submit their ID for digital onboarding, contributing to a seamless and user-friendly experience.
