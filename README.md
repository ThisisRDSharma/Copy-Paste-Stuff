Acuant plays a critical role in verifying the identities of customers who have onboarded via the Digital Bank platform.

As of March 31, 2024, the Digital Bank had successfully onboarded a total of 49,103 customers who opened active deposit accounts through the bankâ€™s online platform. This means these customers completed the digital onboarding process, which likely included submitting identification documents for verification, with Acuant performing the ID scanning and validation.

In addition to the number of customers, these digitally onboarded customers collectively manage an aggregate portfolio balance of $771,229,472. This large portfolio balance indicates a substantial amount of assets held within these accounts, reflecting not only the success of the digital onboarding process but also the trust and reliance customers place on the Digital Bank for their banking needs.
