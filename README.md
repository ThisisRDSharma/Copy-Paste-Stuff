### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Green Models** are reviewed quarterly with no escalation unless a negative trend is detected.  
- **Amber Models** require **monthly** review, and if underperformance persists, escalation moves to **senior risk leaders**.  
- **Red Models** are checked **bi-weekly**, with a rapid escalation plan involving senior management, compliance, and potential regulatory action.  

Would you like to incorporate any specific KPIs or additional risk thresholds in the plan?



Here's an updated and detailed explanation of FAR, FRR, along with the thresholds and action/escalation plan, considering your preference for more conservative thresholds and a FAR under 10% as green.

### **Detailed Explanation of FAR & FRR**  

1. **False Acceptance Rate (FAR)**  
   - FAR is a measure of how often unauthorized transactions or users are incorrectly accepted by the fraud detection system.
   - **High FAR** indicates a system that is too lenient, which increases the risk of fraudulent transactions.
   - **Low FAR** implies a more robust model that catches fraud effectively but might impact the user experience.

2. **False Rejection Rate (FRR)**  
   - FRR is the rate at which legitimate transactions or users are incorrectly rejected by the system.
   - **High FRR** means legitimate users are being unnecessarily blocked or frustrated, which impacts customer satisfaction.
   - **Low FRR** ensures that valid users pass smoothly through the system but may increase fraud if the system becomes too lenient.

### **Threshold Levels with Monitoring Frequency**  

| **RAG Status** | **Threshold for FAR** | **Threshold for FRR** | **Monitoring Frequency** |
|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Green** (Low Risk)  | FAR ‚â§ 10%  | FRR ‚â§ 5%  | Quarterly ‚Äì Routine review for model performance, reassessing thresholds and identifying patterns. |
| **Amber** (Moderate Risk)  | 10% < FAR ‚â§ 15%  | 5% < FRR ‚â§ 8%  | Monthly ‚Äì Closer monitoring of models for potential drift or irregularities, minor adjustments may be needed. |
| **Red** (High Risk)  | FAR > 15%  | FRR > 8%  | Bi-weekly ‚Äì Intensive monitoring for immediate adjustments and to determine root causes of any significant deviations. |

### **Action Plan & Escalation Process for FAR & FRR Breaches**  

| **Threshold Breach Level** | **Course of Action (Modeling Department)** | **Escalation Process** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Green (FAR ‚â§ 10%, FRR ‚â§ 5%)**  | - Continue monitoring as per routine. - Ensure that the model is updated based on new data patterns. - Perform periodic checks for model drift and recalibration. | - No immediate escalation needed. - Ensure that fraud team is informed of any minor model tweaks. |
| **Amber (10% < FAR ‚â§ 15%, 5% < FRR ‚â§ 8%)** | 1. Review model performance metrics. 2. Investigate potential data drifts, rule inefficiencies, or external factors contributing to changes. 3. Optimize model parameters or thresholds where necessary. 4. Run additional validation tests. | - Escalate to Fraud Management Team for further analysis of the impact. - Conduct a model review with the Data Science/Modeling Department for fine-tuning and adjustments. |
| **Red (FAR > 15%, FRR > 8%)** | 1. Perform an immediate root-cause analysis. 2. Temporarily adjust thresholds to stricter settings (e.g., manual review or multi-factor authentication). 3. Evaluate external factors such as recent changes in transaction volume or fraud patterns. 4. Retrain the model using the latest data and adjust model features. | - Immediate escalation to Senior Management and Compliance Team. - Engage in high-priority meetings with key stakeholders to assess overall system performance, user experience impact, and compliance concerns. - Consider emergency deployment of additional fraud detection measures. |

### **Key Considerations for Escalation Plans:**  
1. **Green Status (Routine)**: When the system is operating within thresholds, normal operation continues. If a minor discrepancy is noted, it is addressed in quarterly reviews.
2. **Amber Status (Moderate Risk)**: Breaches here require more focused intervention. Actions such as model recalibration or rule adjustments should be done promptly. Escalations help identify any larger operational or strategic issues.
3. **Red Status (High Risk)**: Severe breaches need immediate action. Stricter measures must be implemented quickly, followed by a detailed review of all aspects of the fraud detection model and system. Escalations should involve the highest level of management, ensuring the organization‚Äôs compliance and reputation are safeguarded.
