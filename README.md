The Acuant model outcome plays a key role in supporting the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regulatory requirements, particularly regarding enhanced due diligence for new digital banking customer onboarding. The model is specifically designed to ensure that the identification provided by new customers is thoroughly authenticated, which is a critical step in maintaining compliance with BSA regulations.

This model helps prevent emerging fraud schemes, including synthetic identity fraud, where fraudsters create fake identities by combining real and fabricated information. To counter this, Acuant uses advanced technology to authenticate the identification documents provided during onboarding. Specifically, the model leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract and analyze the data from IDs, verifying that the information on the document matches expected patterns and standards for legitimate identification.

In addition to the OCR-based authentication process, the Acuant model also plays a crucial role in identifying potential risks. If a customer's identification document is flagged as potentially fraudulent or tampered with, the system escalates the case to the BSA Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) group for further review.
